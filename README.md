The database consists of two (2) tables, meal_plans and user_profiles created in the supabase database schema

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app. The login and logout function along with the sign up are authenticated by Supabase and saved in the user_profiles table.

This is a project made with the help of AI and the Next.js frameworks. I have no knowledge or experience in TypeScript so I needed to search how to build this from Youtube as well

The web app consists of a sign up and sign in functionality.

The home page shows the simple meal planner setup where the user can input their meals for each day of the week and save it in the supabase database.

There is also a remove functionality represented by the X button near the items/meals in each day.

This is made using VS Code and Git, not deployed in vercel due to some issues, but to run the development server:
  clone this repository and run "npm run dev"
  Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
